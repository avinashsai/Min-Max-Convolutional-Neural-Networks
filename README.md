# Min-Max-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

A Pytorch implementation of Min-Max Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification. It is implemented for MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented a Custom MIN-MAX Convolution Block.

# Model Architecture.

Used a LeNet type Architecture with Conv->Pool->Conv->Pool->Conv->Pool->FC->FC(OUTPUT LAYER)

## For MNIST
